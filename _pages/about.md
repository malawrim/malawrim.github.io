<p>Welcome! My name is Margaret Lawrimore and I am a second year PhD Student in Geospatial Analytics at North Carolina State University (NCSU). </p>

<p>I discovered my love for geospatial science during my undergraduate studies at NCSU. I majored in Environmental Sciences and while exploring different interests, I took my first GIS class. Within a couple weeks of class I knew I wanted to turn this interest into my career. As a result, I created a concentration in Geospatial Information Science and minored in Computer Programming to improve my technical profiency. Upon graduating in May, 2020, I followed this interest into a full-time Research Assistant position with NCSU's Center for Geospatial Analytics. Here, I worked on the development team for the Pest or Pathogen Spread (PoPS) model and tool development projects with the NC Department of Transporation. In Fall 2021, I transitioned from Research Assistant to Geospatial Analytics PhD Student. Since then, I have contributed to a national assessment of flood risk, computed spatial-temporal simulations of urban growth, and leveraged machine learning and HPC to predict gaps in zoning codes. </p>
